# Typescript Starter

## Overview

This is a standalone starter project that you can customize to your liking right out of the box. Here is a bullet list showing some of the more notable things going on:

- TypeScript
- Sass/SCSS
- Babel
- Webpack

Here are some suggestions of what to do first:

- Decide what to do about the git history if you cloned this repo. Leave it? Cool.
- Change the project info the `package.json` file.
- Update the dependencies?

> Please note: This is not a template-based solution at this time. If it were, it would probably be a project-generator or a plug-in for an existing generator that someone else made.

## Getting started

1. Clone, fork, or download this repo.
2. Run `npm i` in your terminal from the project folder to install the dependencies.
